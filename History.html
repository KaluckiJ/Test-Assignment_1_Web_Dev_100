			<h1>History | Point Breeze</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>According to historical maps</strong>, much of what is South Philadelphia including Point Breeze was still not yet developed and integrated into the rectilinear grid system by 1843 or later. <em>Point Breeze</em> was a point on the western side of the Schuylkill River approximately where the Passyunk Avenue bridge is today. It and the area across from it on the eastern side of the river were established as an area for oil refinery in the 1860s by Atlantic Petroleum Storage Company, later the Atlantic Refining Company. From this point, oil that had been drilled in Western Pennsylvania could be processed and then shipped down the Schuylkill, to the Delaware and out to sea.

				<strong>Through the 1960s</strong>, Point Breeze was reported to be a safe, clean, relatively integrated and self-sufficient neighborhood with a thriving business district along Point Breeze Avenue itself known to residents as "The Breeze." Racial tensions, fear of race riots and white flight in the 1960s and '70s saw many businesses move away and shifted the demographics of the neighborhood to mostly African American. The heroin epidemic of the 70's and crack epidemic of the '90s and its related crime also affected Point Breeze. Between 1988 and 1990 the Philadelphia Police department performed a series of raids in Point Breeze effectively shutting down the Carr family drug ring which reportedly had been selling $1.3 million per year in crack, cocaine and prescription drugs

				<strong>In the 2000s</strong> and beyond Point Breeze has shown further revitalization partially due to gentrification. Real estate investors like John Longacre and Ori Feibush have begun developing property in Point Breeze, especially along Broad Street and Washington Avenue. A section of Point Breeze east of 18th Street is now being called Newbold by some developers, residents and neighborhood organizations. This is highly controversial amongst some residents of Point Breeze.
