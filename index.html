			<h1>Point Breeze, Philadelphia</h1>
			<p>
				Point Breeze is a neighborhood in the <strong>South Philadelphia</strong> section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. It is generally bound by 25th Street to the west, Washington Avenue to the north, Broad Street to the east, and Mifflin Street to the south, although the sections between 18th Street and Broad Street are coming into their own neighborhood as Newbold. Southwest Center City lies to its north, and Passyunk Square lies to its east. <em>Point Breeze is separated from Grays Ferry to the west by a CSX railway viaduct over 25th Street.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Point Breeze neighborhood suffered from abandonment and population decline throughout the mid 20th century. Today it is a neighborhood under revitalization from efforts steered by South Philadelphia H.O.M.E.S. Inc. and the Point Breeze Community Development Coalition Inc., in addition to such organizations as Neighbors in Action, Universal Companies, Point Breeze Business Association, Point Breeze Pioneers greening group and other prominent Philadelphia organizations.
